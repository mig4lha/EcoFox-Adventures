# EcoFox Adventures ü¶ä
## _Saving the forest, one tree at a time!_ 

In EcoFox Adventures, players take on the role of a fox navigating a forest under threat. The game emphasizes environmental awareness by introducing levels where the fox has to clean up waste from the trees in their surroundings. The game incorporates a storyline where pollution progressively affects the forest and players must ‚Äúheal‚Äù sections and destroy the robots that are destroying the forest to reach the next level. Make sure to defeat as many of robots as possible to save the forest!
